The goal of this tool to teach non-programmers the basics of programming. It visualizes
code as a series of blocks, where each block is a function that acts on the data.

The tool also works to as a way to help experienced programmers visualize functional 
programming. It forces programmers away from an object-oriented approach. Instead, this tool
 visualizes their program as a pipeline, where the data is passed through several transformations.
 The most similar tool to this is Simulink.

The tool is turing complete. Any program can be designed in it. However, it is not intended
to support larger, complex programs. It's more of a 'programmer's playground'.
