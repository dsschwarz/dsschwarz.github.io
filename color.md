<p>
This is a short exploration of the color and art direction in a board game I was designing, called Ruins & Raiders. The game is a light, semi-cooperative game where players play as tomb raiders, exploring and looting ancient temples. It is intended to have a light, fun theme, where exploration of the temples comes with risks and rewards, and players can cooperate, or backstab each other to gain an advantage.

<h3>
What role does the color, and overall art style, play?
</h3>
<p>
The color choices are intended to support the theme and mood of the game. The tiles that comprise the temple must draw the players into the experience of exploring ancient temples, with the tiles giving the impression of possible danger or great rewards. They must create an atmosphere of tension and suspense. At the same time, the colors should help support the game’s goal of being fun and light. Using brighter, warmer colors, like oranges and yellows, will be a lot more effective than a dull mix of browns, blacks, and greys. For the sake of immersion, the tiles will be definitely not be abstract. Between a more cartoony style and a more realistic style, a cartoony style would be better suited to maintaining the fun atmosphere.

<p>
Lighting was one of my biggest considerations. Realistically, ruins would be dark, perhaps with some natural light at certain points. The mechanics of the game make is difficult to add natural light to the tiles, since the tiles are randomized and could be either on the edge or the center of the board, and could be facing any direction. The direction of the light would be inconsistent, which I didn’t want. More so, lighting is the perfect chance to add warm colors to the color scheme. In keeping with the ‘tomb raider’ theme, each tile will be illuminated with the yellows and oranges of torchlight. This is preferable to the whiter colors of natural light. Torchlight will also help highlight certain important aspects of the tile, while darkening and downplaying others.

<h3>
Light Source Placement
</h3>
<p>
The light could either come from the center of the room, simulating light coming from the player character, or from the edges, simulating torches in the walls. This decision was pretty simple. It’s completely ridiculous to have lit torches on the walls. It isn’t reasonable to expect some temple janitor to maintain several corridors worth of torches, ready for explorers to come by. The explorers themselves wouldn’t have enough torches to leave a few on the walls of every room they pass through. More game mechanics reasons, it also makes sense to put the light source in the center. The shadows produced by the light would be more clear, and arrayed against the walls of the room around the edge. This will also help highlight either important aspects of the room, or just highlight cool pieces of artwork and theme.

<h3>
Shadows
</h3>
<p>
Shadows play an important role in converting the 2D tiles into 3D rooms. The game is being designed to be played with top down tiles. This limits the amount of work that can be done with the art. However, with good use of shadows, the 3D nature of the rooms can be conveyed.
</p>
<p>
One problem I considered was shadows blending into each other, or losing clarity due to a mix of shadows caused by objects vs shadows added for theme (dark doorways, recesses in walls, pillars, etc). Inspired by the artwork in Serial Experiments Lain, I chose to go with psychadelic purple patterned shadows. This adds more variety to the color pallette, and the strangeness will help with both the atmosphere of tension, and the splash of color will help keep the game feeling light, rather than oppressive. The purple shadows will be used only for objects, to highlight them. Doorways and other less important shadows will use the standard total black. This will resolve the problem with clarity.
